create a linear regression model for analyzing road accident severity using the relevant dataset related to the scenario. please specify the dependent variable (the variable you want to predict) and the independent variables (the factors that influence the accident severity). after creating the model, save it for future use. then, provide an example of using the model to predict accident severity for a hypothetical set of independent variables, and explain how such a model could be beneficial for traffic accident analysis and prevention in underdeveloped countries.
